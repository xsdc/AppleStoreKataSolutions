# Abstract Factory

> Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
>
> _Reference: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_

## Pattern overview

- The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- A common example of the Abstract Factory pattern is a user interface toolkit, where the factory can create different types of buttons, menus, and windows.
- The Abstract Factory pattern is similar to the Factory Method pattern, but it creates an entire family of products instead of a single product.

## Problem statement

- For the Apple Store, consider categories of products such as iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks.
- Each category has different models. For iPad: iPad mini, iPad Air, iPad Pro, and iPad.
- Each model has different configurations.
- We can use the abstract factory pattern to create a factory for each category of products.

## Domain application

Abstract Factory:

Declares an interface for operations that create abstract product objects.

```swift
protocol SeriesFactory {
    func createProductA() -> AbstractProductA
    func createProductB() -> AbstractProductB
}
```

Concrete Factory:

Implements the operations to create concrete product objects.

```swift
class AppleFactory: MacFactory, WatchFactory {
    func createMacBookPro() -> Mac {
        return MacBookPro()
    }

    func createMacBookAir() -> Mac {
        return MacBookAir()
    }

    func createAppleWatchSeries() -> AppleWatch {
        return AppleWatchSeries()
    }

    func createAppleWatchUltra() -> AppleWatch {
        return AppleWatchUltra()
    }
}
```

AbstractProduct:

Declares an interface for a type of product object.

```swift
protocol AbstractProductA {
    func usefulFunctionA() -> String
}
```

ConcreteProduct:

- Defines a product object to be created by the corresponding concrete factory.
- Implements the AbstractProduct interface.

```swift
class ConcreteProductA1: AbstractProductA {
    func usefulFunctionA() -> String {
        return "The result of the product A1."
    }
}
```

Client:

Uses only interfaces declared by AbstractFactory and AbstractProduct classes.

```swift
class Client {
    private var productA: AbstractProductA
    private var productB: AbstractProductB

    init(factory: AbstractFactory) {
        productA = factory.createProductA()
        productB = factory.createProductB()
    }

    func run() {
        print(productA.usefulFunctionA())
        print(productB.usefulFunctionB())
    }
}
```
